    <h2>Tacos arabes are a wonderful fusion of Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine</h2>
    <p>Tacos árabes are, as the name suggests, "Arab" tacos, and they come from the city of Puebla in Mexico. It's hard to get a crystal-clear explanation of their origins, but the basic story is that Middle Eastern immigrants* arrived in Puebla sometime around or shortly after the First World War and brought with them the shawarma-making tradition of serving thinly sliced, spit-roasted marinated lamb in pita bread. </p>
    <h3>Here are the ingredients to make this wonderful dish.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 500g – 1 lb pork steak, sliced thinly in strips</li> 
        <li> 2 tablespoon lime juice</li>

        <li> 1 large Spanish onion, sliced in thin wedges</li>
        <li> A handful of finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon fresh thyme</li> 
        <li> 2 tablespoon oregano</li> 
        <li> 4 bay leaves</li>
        <li> 2 cloves of garlic</li> 
        <li> Generous pinch of salt</li> 
        <li> 4 tablespoon cooking oil</li> 
    </ul>
